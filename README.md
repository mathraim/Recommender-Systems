# Recommender-Systems
Implemented Collaborative filtering algorithm from scratch for movie recommender system

In this exercise, I implemented collaborative filtering from scratch to build a recommender system for movies

- ex8_cofi.m - Octave/MATLAB script for second part of exercise 
- ex8_movies.mat - Movie Review Dataset
- ex8_movieParams.mat - Parameters provided for debugging 
- checkCostFunction.m - Gradient checking for collaborative filtering 
- computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients
- fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc) 
- loadMovieList.m - Loads the list of movies into a cell-array
- movie ids.txt - List of movies
- normalizeRatings.m - Mean normalization for collaborative filtering 
- cofiCostFunc.m - Implement the cost function for collaborative filtering

Submited to and evaluated by Machine Learning Coursera course as Stanford
